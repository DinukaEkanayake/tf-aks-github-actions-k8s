#A user accesses https://myapp.test.com/ in a browser.The Ingress Controller receives the request.
#It checks the rules in the Ingress configuration.
#Since the host matches (myapp.test.com), it forwards the request to the internal service (myapp-service).
#The service sends the request to the correct Pod running the application.
